                    <h3> User Reaserch </h3>
                    <p> This journey began with thorough research and investigation into the problem at hand. As a first step, we analyzed competitors in terms of their brand, features, and positioning on the market. Based on this analysis, we identified the ideal position in the market.</p>

                        <p>Moving on from the initial step and aiming to understand users and their needs, we conducted a survey that was answered by over 100 individuals in total. Fifty respondents identified the lack of suitable information for healthy weight loss as their biggest challenge, while sixty individuals found it difficult to sustain their weight loss journey. </p>
                        
                       <p> Based on their answers, we conducted interviews with five individuals to delve deeper into the reasons behind the survey results. We recorded the interviews and, with the assistance of affinity diagrams, identified the most recurring themes. We discovered that users struggle with navigating through the vast amount of weight loss-related information, which leaves them feeling lost and unable to commit to a specific plan, ultimately leading to a loss of motivation and the inability to sustain their efforts. </p>

    <h2>User Interface</h2>
    <p>After completing the user research phase and testing low-fidelity and medium-fidelity designs, we moved on to the user interface (UI) department. As a first step, we conducted a visual comparison among competitors which are: NOOM, WW and Un. The goal was to learn from their information presentation methods and also to build a new and distinct identity from what has been done before.</p>
